Alex,

It's really badass that you're becoming a programer, but you are also a super good designer!

Really, its your strength --> I can imagine that you may live in a space between the two areas, but don't forget about design, which is really fun!

I know you arn't intersted, but you should really try to spread out your creative efforts into both the technical and the creative side. I'd like to see you explore:

	Typography
	Image treatments
	Dynamic // Unexpected Compsitions
	UI + UX Elements

Setting a schedule that has full days devoted to each of these ideas will help.
