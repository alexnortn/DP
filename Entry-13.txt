Organic Interaction Design (OID)

==

	I think you have a really cool concept here.

	It doesn't ask you to step out of your comfort zone, well it does! but it the right way.

	You will explore the notion of Organic Information Design across both digital + tactile environments.

		- How can interaction design be inspired by organic systems?

	How can we build interfaces + objects whose behaviours feel natural + adaptive. We will focus more on the behavioral side of things, allowing the form to follow function. The critters form is not limited by natural form, it can certainly take inspiration from those places, but mostly we're concerned with the behaviours.

	What happens when you assign sophistocated interaction to an apprently simple interface/object?

		- You create an emergent system.

	The speed of computing --> [ (NoT) || (OiD) ] + (IoT) ==  (FoT)

	But watch out for buzzwords, know what's out there, but more importantly, ask yourself what isn't out there *yet.

	What about organizing culture?

		- New York Times API.
		- A new way to ogranize large amounts of content
		- Taking into consideration that amount of content and the density of the data. 
		- Bringing legibility and context.

	A Data Viz organized by the principles of reductionism + Wa (Japanese design asthetics)

	Reducing large complexities to qualitative inferences

		- You have all this 'big data' how do you make sense of it?

	Data structures + queries that grow and evolve to 'fit' your unique needs.

		- How can you graphic design this?
		- Pull back from comp.sci

	Organizing thought space.

		- Here are my interests
		- Let's set up a query system
		- Ok, get to work and start building me [n] unique clusters.
		- This is sort of meta; you're designing a system to help you to understand your thoughts.

	Abstractly using physics + attactors to create a more abstract force-directed plot.

	Start with a really flat page, start neutral --> let the page grow with interaction. Can the page learn + adapt to it's usage?

	Brian suggests that people who are spread futher apart realize, better, the value of each other. When in cities, people are somehow less concerned with each other.

	Feeling super disconnected from this place that I've been stuck in.
