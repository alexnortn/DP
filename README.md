Undergraduate Degree Project

==

So there's just no way that my degree project won't leverage the power of programming. Programming allows me to not only reach a far broader audience, it also allows me to pull from a larger variety of people, places, & things. The internet is a wonderful thing. 

Somehow, I can't help but miss a time when things were a bit simpler..

What about a time when there was pleasure to be had in the wilderness, exploring far ranging spaces, interacting with the Nature of Things (NoT), as a opposed to living within the ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT)?

David Rose said it best when he explained the value in the _legacies of his grand fathers tools. Something about having a  specific tool for each and every task is a really beautiful way to live. However, it is certainly not sustainable.

Everyday more people move to cities; the urban landscape _is most definitely the future of things (FoT). We're already seeing this New Communism+Socialism in the form of reduced private ownership in favor of shared-use services.
  ?> Why own a car when you can Uber or Lyft?
  ?> Sustainable urban transport systems like Hubway dramatically increase the accessiblity of a city.

How will the profusion of physical computing effect our expectations and long held ideas on meaning and value of technology?

The fastest microprocessors complete over 5 million cycles per second -a totally unfathomably number. While all those cycles are massively powerful, they are often overwhelming. 

I am profoundly interesting Humanizing the front-end (the graphical interfaces, and interactive elements of technology).

Design a series of small experiments exploring the interplay+reaction between computers+people. The method

NoT && IoT || FoT;

		It was super inspiring, but mostly  because of the really high quality renderings!

	IDEAS / CONCEPTS


	Projection Mapping in a dark room, use physical objects to 'interact'

	Physical Computing, or Pervassive Computing as a way to _pipe this IoT world back into a NoT one.

	Slow Game // That mentality.

	MENTALITY // PROCES

	I've never found it difficult to engage in a really large project. I'm very capable at diving in head first and learning all that I can learn. I am confident that given enough time anything is possible. Unfortunately time is sort of an expensive commodity. Learning to work within a certain time frame could be incredibly benificial. What if I was tasked to develop+prototype engaging work in only 2 weeks? Is that enough time to make significant progress on a single idea? To at least make an effort at raising quesitons or awareness?

	The projects wouldn't be standing alone. I guess the smaller projects would all sort of sit within a larger umbrella idea. In effect, each micro project would be an essential component to something much larger. Emergent systems: The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts; when you bring all these simple experiments together, one is able to glean just that much more!

	IT is crucially important that this all be documented. I will design a modularizedweb framework that allows for exceptional documentation of my work; this will evolve to be my personal work site :]

Permanence- what does it mean when we solidify something so strongly that it never could change.

Talking about man made structures, products, and ideas!
