Undergraduate Degree Project

So there's just no way that my degree project won't leverage the power of programming. Programming allows me to not only reach a far broader audience, it also allows me to pull from a larger variety of people, places, & things. The internet is a wonderful thing. 

Somehow, I can't help but miss a time when things were a bit simpler..

What about a time when there was pleasure to be had in the wilderness, exploring far ranging spaces, interacting with the Nature of Things (NoT), as a opposed to living within the ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT)?

David Rose said it best when he explained the value in the _legacies of his grand fathers tools. Something about having a  specific tool for each and every task is a really beautiful way to live. However, it is certainly not sustainable.

Everyday more people move to cities; the urban landscape _is most definitely the future of things (FoT). We're already seeing this New Communism+Socialism in the form of reduced private ownership in favor of shared-use services.
  ?> Why own a car when you can Uber or Lyft?
  ?> Sustainable urban transport systems like Hubway dramatically increase the accessiblity of a city.

How will the profusion of physical computing effect our expectations and long held ideas on meaning and value of technology?

The fastest microprocessors complete over 5 million cycles per second -a totally unfathomably number. While all those cycles are massively powerful, they are often overwhelming. 

I am profoundly interesting Humanizing the front-end (the graphical interfaces, and interactive elements of technology).

NoT && IoT || FoT;

		It was super inspiring, but mostly  because of the really high quality renderings!

	IDEAS / CONCEPTS


	Projection Mapping in a dark room, use physical objects to 'interact'

	Physical Computing, or Pervassive Computing as a way to _pipe this IoT world back into a NoT one.

	Slow Game // That mentality.
