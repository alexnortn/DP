Undergraduate Degree Project

So there's just no way that my degree project won't leverage the power of programming. Programming allows me to not only reach a far broader audience, it also allows me to pull from a larger variety of people, places, & things. The internet is a wonderful thing. 

Somehow, I can't help but miss a time when things were a bit simpler..

What about a time when there was pleasure to be had in the wilderness, exploring far ranging spaces, interacting with the Nature of Things (NoT), as a opposed to living within the ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT)?

David Rose said it best when he explained the value in the _legacies of his grand fathers tools. Something about having a  specific tool for each and every task is a really beautiful way to live. However, it is certainly not sustainable.

Everyday more people move to cities; the urban landscape _is most definitely the future of things (FoT). We're already seeing this New Communism+Socialism in the form of reduced private ownership in favor of shared-use services.
  ?> Why own a car when you can Uber or Lyft?
  ?> Sustainable urban transport systems like Hubway dramatically increase the accessiblity of a city.
