Transforming

	Quantitative Information --> Qualitative Experience + Empathy

==

Doing some kind of visualization or analysis of content within the NYT API could be super cool!

	What are we interested in?
		
		Classifying
		Clustering

How do we move into this stuff?

	I mean, there's already a website in place...
	Am I suggesting that I can do it better?

Getting better at UI Design + Data Viz will be really powerful!
	
	Looking for metaphor
	Building a digital experience for something that you (and others) care about
	|
	^
	Sentiment analysis --> Procedurally coloring // laying out a page?
		-Text
		-What kind of an article is this?
		-Oh, in that case, add these styles + effects
			+We're not quite* ready to do this with images yet, (give it 5 years)
		-Flesch Classifier, NLP 

	Again, this is cool tech, really brilliant but sort of lacking in hummanity.

Always this idea of:

	Generative Design
	Evolutionary+Genetic Algorithms
	ML
	NLP+SA
	Procedural Architectures

What about some kind of self configuring experience?

	I can imagine a sort of experience to reduce stress, or just sort of keep you busy. The tricky part is for every customizable 'trait' or possible 'adaption' the system must also become more complex.

	You want this system to be fairly simple...
	I would guess?

	You want to avoid this idea of creating templates though
	Personalization --> Yes.

==

Optomizing towards a goal // being able to alter the goal!

	Then it needs to be fun + playful.

	So you've got a pretty decent handle on the technology required, or at least a handle on where to learn it.

	Now.

	Apply it.

Artisan quality, masterful form, ultimate simplicity in even the most mundane objects.

All things have the potential to be great!
