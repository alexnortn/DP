	Intuitive Data Visualization


		I'll be investigating primarily written documents: news headlines, articles, books, lyrics, poetry, scripts etc. looking for the similarities and differences that arise when we break language down to its most fundamental components. Using a technique known as 'Natural Language Processing' (NLP for short) syntax (form), semantics (meaning) and sentiment (feeling) can be distilled, quantified and to a certain degree qualified. 

		Conscious currents seeks to imbue this data with the dynamic orgranic characteristics found principally in systems of living things. For instance the flocking behaviours of birds or the predatory instinct of a lion. How is data transformed through movement, emotion and desire? What intuitive perceptions might it demonstrate?

		Inspiration for this proces stems from my love of complexity and more importatnly my love for distilling complexity into simple 'intuitive' systems. I believe that creative a visual language that behaves similarily to natural systems will offer surprising new insights into the dense world of written language.
