	!Walled Garden --> Open Source

		A closed platform, walled garden or closed ecosystem is a software system where the carrier or service provider has control over applications, content, and media, and restricts convenient access to non-approved applications or content. This is in contrast to an open platform, where consumers have unrestricted access to applications, content, and much more.

	How many senses do humans have?
	Sense

		A sense is a physiological capacity of organisms that provides data for perception. The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience, cognitive psychology (or cognitive science), and philosophy of perception. The nervous system has a specific sensory system or organ, dedicated to each sense.

		Recall Kenya Hara's essay from "Designing Design" where he explains 'Haptic' sensing, and augmenting the human sensory experience more than the base five senses:

			- Sight
			- Touch
			- Taste
			- Sound
			- Smell

			+ Stuff from Enchanted Objects

		The Neuroscience of Sensing + Perception

			Or why physical, tactile, + material still matter.

			Design information gathering + expressing systems that function similarly to a neural network; this includes both the physiology, anatomy, and taxonomy of the idividual cells.
