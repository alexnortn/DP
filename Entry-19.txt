Christmas for dad

==

Dad loves his electric jacket --> could you create a simple IC that would regulate the usage of electricity in his jacket? Thereby conserving more power and enhancing his well-being?

It would pull from some external temp sensor to create a map of the weather data.. then it would inrementally ramp up the internal voltage to achieve some sort of equilibrium.

You are the master of over thinking shit.
