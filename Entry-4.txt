        -- visualizing your genetic code,,,
        --I suppose that Ben Fry sort of approaches this idea? But its still very inhuman..how could this be translated?
        --Neurobiology, Biological Systems,Computational Biology
        --Genetic Algorithms
        --Neural Networks <ANN> <CNN>
        --Machine Learning
But recall that it's important to remember people- I mean this is super cool+complex even ground breaking; need to connect to people

You're diving too deep, I would say.

Bringing it back,

This idea of emergence can be applied in a simpler way to the system of systems that will be developed during the process of this defree project.

Relating back to that comment on AI and the possibility of creating an autonomous future.. It's critical to focus on automating things that remove us from this 'human' experience, not automating those things that make us feel alive.
