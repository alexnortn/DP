Alex,

It might be nice to set up some kind of a schedule to at least attempt to keep your head on straight!

	Running
	Programing
		Learning
		Actually* Coding
	Designing
	Fun Literally*

It's important.

	SO there's like a todo list...
	
	Then there are these hard constraints that make 'life' good.

I would push you to resolve at least some kind of a thesis tomorrow morning...
