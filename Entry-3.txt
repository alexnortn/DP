	Kevin Hu
				Kevin a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, he works in the Macro Connections Group under Cesar Hidalgo. His aim is to 'Democratize Data' to create software that allows everyone from data journalists, scientists, and consultants to utilize legible and dynamic data+analytics.

				He asks some really interesting questions about qualifying culture from data. Can computers become emotionally responsive to images; instead of seeing pixels and numbers, intelligence.

					Personal Question: When does all this data get in the way of simply* living

					Is there a way to combine/leverage these mountains of data with the simple* 'empty' lifestyle+design strategies found in Scandinavian & Japanese Design + Living

					Crowdsourcing is intersting, for instance Kevin's work with GifGif, which seems strikinly similar to Cesar's project about the defensible space.

				"I’d like to change the public’s opinion about experimentation. Human experimentation is an incredibly loaded term, for many very good reasons, and when Facebook said that they were experimenting with people’s newsfeeds, there was outrage. I think it’s kind of absurd. This is how software companies make tools. They test on their users and provide a service for free, and in exchange they use your data set. I would like to see people be open and accepting of the fact that by contributing a little bit of anonymous information, they can help scientists better understand bigger issues like information flow, social network formation. I think that that should definitely change."

					We’re aiming towards more paradigm shifts than incremental research.

				"A lot of people imagine people at the lab as people off in the air dreaming about what the next big thing will be, but really it’s just regular people having conversations and they happen to be asking, ‘what could be impactful?’ We’re aiming towards more paradigm shifts than incremental research. Is this going to be a game changer? Most of the time, the answer is ‘no,’ by definition, but it’s nice to be in a place where that is one of the first questions."

	Modelling the Scaling Properties of Human Mobility
				Individual human trajectories are characterized by fat-tailed distributions of jump sizes and waiting times, suggesting the relevance of continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) models for human mobility. However, human traces are barely random. Given the importance of human mobility, from epidemic modelling to traffic prediction and urban planning, we need quantitative models that can account for the statistical characteristics of individual human trajectories. Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile-phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws, but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.

	The Scaling Laws of Human Travel
				The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronize populations of interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene pools1, 2, 3. Human travel, for example, is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic10, the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as Lévy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.
