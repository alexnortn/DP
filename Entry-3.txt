				Kevin a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, he works in the Macro Connections Group under Cesar Hidalgo. His aim is to 'Democratize Data' to create software that allows everyone from data journalists, scientists, and consultants to utilize legible and dynamic data+analytics.

				He asks some really interesting questions about qualifying culture from data. Can computers become emotionally responsive to images; instead of seeing pixels and numbers, intelligence.

					Personal Question: When does all this data get in the way of simply* living

					Is there a way to combine/leverage these mountains of data with the simple* 'empty' lifestyle+design strategies found in Scandinavian & Japanese Design + Living

					Crowdsourcing is intersting, for instance Kevin's work with GifGif, which seems strikinly similar to Cesar's project about the defensible space.

				"I’d like to change the public’s opinion about experimentation. Human experimentation is an incredibly loaded term, for many very good reasons, and when Facebook said that they were experimenting with people’s newsfeeds, there was outrage. I think it’s kind of absurd. This is how software companies make tools. They test on their users and provide a service for free, and in exchange they use your data set. I would like to see people be open and accepting of the fact that by contributing a little bit of anonymous information, they can help scientists better understand bigger issues like information flow, social network formation. I think that that should definitely change."

					We’re aiming towards more paradigm shifts than incremental research.

				"A lot of people imagine people at the lab as people off in the air dreaming about what the next big thing will be, but really it’s just regular people having conversations and they happen to be asking, ‘what could be impactful?’ We’re aiming towards more paradigm shifts than incremental research. Is this going to be a game changer? Most of the time, the answer is ‘no,’ by definition, but it’s nice to be in a place where that is one of the first questions."
