	"Space is a void,  a pocket of air that must be contained to define a limit. This precision coincides with an indespensable existence around it, that grants identity. Space is defined by form, texture, color, temperature, smell, light. Also as a void, a mental process of control over construction where space is at the core: adding subtraction, building excavation. If shifts the center of experience from form to life. At the forefront,  space: nearly autonomous, nearly absolute."

	Space... the only frontier.
