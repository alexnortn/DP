When this design is successful; there is no else.

	A French architect who explores the relationships between void and space, often using white,

	"Space is a void,  a pocket of air that must be contained to define a limit. This precision coincides with an indespensable existence around it, that grants identity. Space is defined by form, texture, color, temperature, smell, light. Also as a void, a mental process of control over construction where space is at the core: adding subtraction, building excavation. If shifts the center of experience from form to life. At the forefront,  space: nearly autonomous, nearly absolute."


White is not just a color. White must be called a design concept.

	"As a professional graphic designer, I naturally use color. However, when I do so, it's with a consciousness of its function, or because it represents an emotion I'm after... But if there's no particular reason for them, you'll find no extra colors on my design table. Where its a high-tech or a natural material, I always look at the color of the material itself. Doing this, I gradually became conscious of white. White is a color from which has escaped, but it's diversity is boundless. When I encounter a really good white, I get this feeling that the collection of senses stored in my brain has increased by one."
