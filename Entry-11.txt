Organic Interaction Design (OID)
	
	Continuing the OID discourse from Entry-9

	Inspired by Ben Fry's masters thesis "Organic Information Design"

	Also, Ben Fry's Doctoral Thesis "Computational Information Design."

	This is not a Data Visualization project
	It *may* be a Data Interaction project
	I would like it to be specifically a OID project

	Machine Learning (ML)
	Computer Vision (CV)
	Genetics
	Computational Biology

	"Computational Information Design" which seeks to combine he multpiple discipines of Graphic Design, Computer Science, & Statistics together to create a better understanding of Data Visualization.

	Ben suggests combining:

		- Graphic Design
		- Computer Science
		- Statistics

	What about adding in these to deal with people, the macro-scale interactions, and even aggregate tendancies:

		- Neuroscience
		- Cognitive Psychology
		- Sociology

	And use these tools to apply micro-scale systemic organization + clustering + emergence to macro scale interactions:

		- Compuational Biology
		- Physics

	Heuristic 

	(/hjʉˈrɪstɨk/; Greek: "Εὑρίσκω", "find" or "discover")

	Refers to experience-based techniques for problem solving, learning, and discovery that find a solution which is not guaranteed to be optimal, but good enough for a given set of goals. Where the exhaustive search is impractical, heuristic methods are used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution via mental shortcuts to ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples of this method include using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, stereotyping, profiling, or common sense.

	More precisely, heuristics are strategies using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human beings and machines.

	It may be important to make a distinction between the kind of interactions that we'll be exploring. Perhaps it would be prudent to spend my spring semester (at Massart) focusing on OID with respect to GUI design. I am pursuing a degree in Graphic Design, the professors + student body will be more capable in offering relevant feedback if my work explores possibilites offered in these realms.

	Perhaps I could continue my work with Arduino's + Physical Computing somewhere at MIT? Continue your exploration of this stuff sort of part time as a possible beginning for your future career. It's sort of a waste of your $$$ + Time to be pursuing something like this at Massart where there is little relevant feedback or help available.

	For Massart, developing a web platform with a number of engaging interactive experiments could be a worthwhile endeavour. Following graduation, having really solid IA, UI + UX skills will seriously increase my value.

	 	- HTML
	 	- CSS
	 	- JS
	 		- Libraries
		 		+ PhysicsJS
		 		+ ThreeJs
		 		+ Polymer
		 		+ BrainJs --> Machine Learning
		 		+ D3
		 		+ Meteor
		 		+ jQuery
 		- AJAX
 		- Python || C++

	Let's just get really digital in our experience design platform, then ask questions about what sorts of design strategies, media techniques are possible when the environment becomes adaptive, evolutionary, and fitness driven. How quickly can we tailor experience?

		For instance:

		Given a really basic web page, it has a header, followed by [3] here images:

		Could we use OpenCV to immediatly learn what the user is most interested in, then proceed to load the rest of the page with respect to that decision?

		Your not necessarily changing the content- but effecting the order of presentation for maximum engagement!

		Again, this is really easy when we curate all the content- optimization of a single site is easy, sort of. How do we deal with an evolving landscape like a personal blog or flickr page?

	Giving yourself a really solid foundation in these web technologies, and learning some basic algorithms for data parsing, and visualization will be paramount for your graduate research in 'TUI + Radical Atoms'

	That's when you study Computational Biology + Genetics

	Maybe then you can touch NodeJS too : ]

	Making the most of this design education is the most usefull thing that you can do for now.

		- Designing a web experience allows your work to scale dramatically fast, reaching distance employers...

	Gotta do some cool stuff with the UI + UX man, don't get caught up on the programming - there will always be people way the fuck faster than you at that.
