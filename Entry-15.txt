Organic Interaction Design (OID)

	Getting back to people

	Sony --> Paper Watch

==

	Curiousity of a Child

		- Cognitive Development
		- DVN
		- In the beginning of a new experience, everything matters! Oh, the subtly!
			+ That's why start ups are so cool!

		Love Process!

		Why does achieving a level of mastery matter so much?

		Instant gratification --> Fuck Guitar Hero

			- But people like it soo much!
			- What are the good things?
			- This technique of learning new things?

	You're so far out, Alex

	This needs to be fun, and iteratible.. Like enjoy being able to come into class with really simple experiments and be able to improve on them every week so they evolve- and fuck so you can actually enjoy this!

	Have a goal in mind, a road map for progress.

==

	Adaptive Interactions // Organic Behavior

	Acessibility --> Contrast
	Gaining ground // Relativity

	Preference --> Opinion { matters }

	There is no right answer.
		-There's Not.

	Desensitized --> Need Contrast

==

	Building something, making it your own.
	Create a space where people are encouraged to improvise.

		- People feel safe, well informed, but also totally comfortable.
		- Learning platform --> through doing
		- Little Bits for Data Viz

	Get people to improvise in a safe environment but enable them to produce truly* orginal content.

	Back to Monument Valley --

	Why does this game interst you so much? Yes it's a game, but also it's about exploration + discovery.. how can one reward well-considered curiousity? But this all would have to be really abstract.. and naturally, relatively generative on the level of a compound system + dynamic relationships who's sum is greater than it's parts.

	Learning a lot from a little.

	Emergent Systems: (exponential incrementation)

		- IFTTT
		- Neurons
		- Meta --> Brain Function // Architecture

	What are we designing?

		- Game
		- Experience
		- Tool
		- Visualization
		- Dashboard
		- Simulation
		- Narrative
		- Metaphor
		- Representational vs NonRepresentational
		- Technology
		- Scalable

	But does it float?
