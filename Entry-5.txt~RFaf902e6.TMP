Design* a series of small experiments to communicate the core concepts in each of these fields.
  Learning through gamification if a central theme

  Form follows function?
  The method is in the medium?

  Let's just say that, (at this momemnt) I have no preconcieved objectives regarding the construction and production of this project.

    Is it worth considering how this work would scale?

    Yes.

    The project may use advanced fabrication techniques, (Laser Cutting, CNC Routing, 3D Printing) but the project format, and assembly should be designed in such a way that is inexpensive, and reproducable by a modest skill set.

    Applying these limitations helps to inform the final product. Sometimes limiting oneself can be incredibly helpful!
